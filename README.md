## Deploying to Bluemix

Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/company-insights)

Next set your [AlchemyAPI] and [Twitter] keys via either the [Bluemix] web interface or the [`cf` command line tool]:

```sh
cf set-env company-insights ALCHEMY_API_KEY <api_key>
cf set-env company-insights TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY <consumer_key>
cf set-env company-insights TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET <consumer_secret>
cf set-env company-insights TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY <access_token_key>
cf set-env company-insights TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET <access_token_secret>
cf restage company-insights
```

# Local Setup

Requires [Node.js].

Grab a copy of the code and install the dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Compile the front-end assets:

```sh
npm run gulp-build
```

Next create your API keys for [Twitter], [AlchemyAPI], and [Personality Insights].

For private projects, the simplest option is to put your API keys directly in `config.js`.
For public projects, either store them in environment variables, or alternatively, create a file named `.env` like so:

```
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=<api_key>

PERSONALITY_INSIGHTS_USERNAME=<username>
PERSONALITY_INSIGHTS_PASSWORD=<password>

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=<consumer_key>
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=<consumer_secret>
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=<access_token_key>
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<access_token_secret>

# optional, see below
# REDIS_URL=redis://username:password@hostname:port
```
  
Finally, run `npm start` to start app:

```sh
npm start
```

For development, use gulp and nodemon to automatically compile assets and restart your server when there are changes:

```sh
npm install -g gulp nodemon
```

And, then in seperate terminal windows, run
```sh
gulp watch
```

and

```sh
nodemon
```

## Redis caching layer

This app is designed to use a Redis-backed caching layer to provide better performance and use fewer API requests. Although the app works without any caching, it is highly recommended that you enable it, even for development.

To enable Redis caching, set `REDIS_URL` to a redis-style URL:  `redis://username:password@hostname:port`. This may be set in either the environment properties or a `.dotenv` file as shown above.

We recommend [Compose], however any Redis server should work.
